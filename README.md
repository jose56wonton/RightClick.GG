# RightClick.GG

### About
RightClick.GG is a React project I have been working on. It is my first real react project and I am super happy with how it turned out.
If you have ever played League of Legends you know that there are lots of stat website like [OP.GG](na.op.gg). This is basically a simple 
version of that.

## Iteration 1
### Things I Learned
* Bulma CSS framework
* Axios AJAX library
* React Router (Dynamic Pages with HashBrowser)
* Riot Games API
* Webpack
### Reason for incompletion
Webpack is confusing and I can't figure out how to deploy. 9/17

## Iteration 2
### Things I Learned
* Recharts
* Component/Container paradigm
* More Redux 6 reducers and 40 actions
### Reason for incompletion
Lack of inspiration in design. 2/18
