# RightClick.GG

### About
RightClick.GG is a React project I have been working on. It is my first real react project and I am super happy with how it turned out.
If you have ever played League of Legends you know that there are lots of stat website like [OP.GG](na.op.gg). This is basically a simple 
version of that.

## Iteration 1 (9/17)
### Things I Learned
* Bulma CSS framework
* Axios AJAX library
* React Router (Dynamic Pages with HashBrowser)
* Riot Games API
* Webpack
### Reason for incompletion
Webpack is confusing and I can't figure out how to deploy. 

## Iteration 2 (2/18)
### Things I Learned
* Recharts - How to map data from generic objects to graph inputs
* Component/Container paradigm - How to decouple visual and state driven components
* More Redux 6 reducers and 40 actions - How to organize scattered data to prevent redunancy and reduce unnecessary memory usage
* Material-UI - How to customize and style more consistently that coinfo
* React Lifecycles - How to use lifecycle functions to determine rerendering with nested components

I just submitted this project to Riot Games. We will see if I get an api key!
