# RightClick.GG

### About
RightClick.GG is a React project I have been working on. It is my first real react project and I am super happy with how it turned out.
If you have ever played League of Legends you know that there are lots of stat website like [OP.GG](na.op.gg). This is basically a simple 
version of that.

### Things I Learned
This project took me a couple of weeks. That was mostly due to the fact that I am in school and time is hard to come by, but also because I 
was using this project to learn some new technologies. These include:

* Bulma CSS framework
* Axios AJAX library
* React Router (Dynamic Pages with HashBrowser)
* Riot Games API
* Webpack


Unfortunely I am super busy at the moment and am still learning Webpack. So hosting will come soon!
